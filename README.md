# Budgeter
### Hi, my name is Uyen tran and I graduated with a Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering
### This is a program where you can enter the amount of income you make (any amount) and any expenses either monthly or daily and it will calculate
### how much you gain or spent through out the period
### Source code is available as Budgeter.java, including main and other methods I wrote
### If you want to use the program without an IDE, refer to these steps:

1. This game will work on either Windows OS or Mac OS so no stress -- Yayy! ðŸ¥³
2. Make sure that you have Java installed on your PC (very very important ðŸ«¶)
3. Install "Budgeter.jar". This is an executable jar file. I have tried to convert this into a .exe file but it failed to load on my PC.
   Still trying to figure out how to fix this to reduce unecessary steps in starting up the game
4. If you use a Windows OS, open your Command Prompt. Navigate to the search bar of your PC (or file search) and type "cmd". It will direct 
   to the internal command prompt
5. If you use a Mac OS, open your Terminal. Select Applications and navigate to Terminal.
6. Locate your "Budgeter.jar" file and get your file path. Usually if you download a file, it will be under the "Downloads" folder.
7. You can get the file path (if it's under Downloads) as Downloads\Budgeter.jar
8. On the Command Prompt, type in "java -jar yourfilepath.jar". Replace yourfile path with the actual file path of the Budgeter.jar file.
   For example, java -jar Downloads\Budgeter.jar
9. Press Enter and find out how much you have been saving (or spending jk) ðŸ˜„
